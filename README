This is a rudimentary RabbitMQ plugin for Collectd.  It is written in Python, and thus requires the use of the Python plugin for Collectd.

It will accept 7 options from the Collectd plugin configuration :

    Locations of binaries:
    RmqcBin = /usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl
    PmapBin = /usr/bin/pmap
    PidFile = /var/run/rabbitmq/pid
    
    or API information:
    Api = http://localhost:15672/api/queues
    Vhost = /
    UserPass= guest:guest

    Logging:
    Verbose = False

It will attempt to gather the following information:

    From rabbitmqctl list_queues:
    messages
    memory
    consumser

    From pmap of beam.smp:
    memory mapped
    memory writeable/private (used)
    memory shared
